### Treasure Chest

Treasure Chest is an interactive text based adventure game. The aim of the game is for the user to choose their own adventure. Essentially, scenarios are described in a narrative and the user gets to input their choice out of the options given e.g. Option 1, 2 or 3. Depending on the option this leads to a new path, making the game different each time for players.

HERE IS LIVE VERSION: 

### How to Play

* User is given a scenario for example: You are on top of Skull Mountain and you need to get to the base. Do you 
1. Climb down the mountain face by rope
2. Make a raft and descend by Mountain River
3. Walk by foot
* User then gets to input their answer, either: 1, 2 or 3
If user enters the incorrect input the user will be prompted with a invalid Error input message and asked to input again.
* When user reachs the treasure chest in order to open the treasure chest two mini games must be played and won by the user.
1.  Guess the Riddle
* A riddle is presented, the user has three guesses to get it right, if correct moves on to the next game. If incorrect, the game is over.
2. Rock, Paper, Scissors (did not want game to be static game) Gets user selection, gets computer selection and a winner is determined. The first player to reach the score of 2 wins. No points are given if the user and computer draw.

### Testing
* I have manually tested the game by ensuring each path works and the mini games work. I have also tested in anticipation of incorrect user input that an error message appears and user must input correctly.
* I have passed the code through PEP8 Validator testing and can confirm there are no problems.
* Tested in my local terminal on git and also on Heroku terminal.

### PEP 8 Validator

### Bugs
* When I input Rock, Paper, Scissors Game there was an error as this was running before the main() function with the intro to the game. This bug has now been solved as it was an indentation error to do with the control flow of the program. Solved.
